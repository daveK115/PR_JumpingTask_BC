# PR_JumpingTask_BC

This is the Corresponding Code to my Practical Work Topic “Generalization in RL”.
Aim: Understanding generalization of agents across a distribution of environments.

Running file **jumpyBC.py** will train one model on the augmented 'wide' grid training set with the optimal parameters found in the report, and print out the models resulting performance.
Further Experiment Loops can be found in the Jupyter notebook **BC_jumping_task.ipynb**.
